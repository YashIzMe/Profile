                            <p class="card-text">Mini Cart aims to create an app that brings a shopper-friendly environment by eliminating
                                shopping carts, saving space for other customers, and helping in maintaining social distance.
                                It would also make shopping at malls a more sanitized process where the items bought by the
                                customers are not touched or tried on by other customers, at the same time it would eliminate the
                                crowded shopping queues by generating order numbers and sending notifications about the order
                                status.
                                User can sign up using phone number and create username and password for signing in. The app
                                consists of a QR scanner with the help of which the user can fill up their cart. After submitting order
                                and payment, an order number will be generated. As the user scans and checks out with their
                                selected products, the order is to be packed and assembled in a storage room and delivered to the
                                user at the checkout counter. This keeps the products hygienic, stops the spread of germs and helps
                                in maintaining crowds in a proper manner.
                                The user will be notified when their order is ready for pick-up. This reduces the waiting time for
                                users as they won't be waiting in lines to pick-up their orders and can utilize their time as they wish.
                                This application can be used on both android as well as iOS, thus expanding the customer base.</p>
